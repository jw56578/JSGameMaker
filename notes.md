how the hell do you organize this damn stuff


you have a screen with layers

do you add things to a layer or add things to the screen and the screen decides where things go

****
do you say that the screen has one layer for map items, one layer for moveable things ???
how do you decide how many layers there are
why do i even want layers
O in order to maintain the state of something when something else goes over  it
for example if you have grass that is green, monsters can go over grass but then you have to change that spot to monster color, but when they get off the grass it has to turn back green, 
how would you know to turn this cell back to green. you would have to have some complicated logic or just maintain that in a layer and it maintains itself

okay so things do need to be in layers but how do you decide what layer to add a things



need to have a map object that represents things to go on map but doesn't have anything to do with CSS or html
